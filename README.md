# 👋 Hey there! I'm Michael

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a hands-on problem solver who recently made the leap into software development. I come from a technical background working with complex mechanical systems, and now I’m channeling that same energy into writing clean, efficient code.

I recently completed a full-stack Java bootcamp, where I focused on building practical applications using modern tools like Spring Boot and Angular. I enjoy building useful tools, experimenting with new technologies, and collaborating on meaningful projects.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Spring Boot, Angular, Bootstrap, MySQL, JPA/Hibernate  
- **Other Skills:** REST APIs, Agile/Scrum, MVC architecture

### 📌 Projects
- **Skill Villa** – A gamified learning platform built with Angular and Spring Boot  
- **Powder Pals** – Full-stack MVC app connecting snow sport enthusiasts  
Check them out in my pinned repositories!

### 🔭 Current Focus
- Building real-world projects and tools
- Learning advanced backend patterns
- Exploring DevOps and deployment workflows

### 🌱 Goals
- Join a mission-driven development team
- Contribute to open-source and collaborative projects
- Keep growing, one commit at a time
