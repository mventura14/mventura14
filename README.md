# üëã Hey there! I'm Michael

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a hands-on problem solver who recently made the leap into software development. I come from a technical background working with complex mechanical systems, and now I‚Äôm channeling that same energy into writing clean, efficient code.

I recently completed a full-stack Java bootcamp, where I focused on building practical applications using modern tools like Spring Boot and Angular. I enjoy building useful tools, experimenting with new technologies, and collaborating on meaningful projects.
